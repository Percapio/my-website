# Crypto Challenge
_work in progress..._
### Objective
* To instill basic understanding of cryptography through writing code and explaining the learning process by exploring algorithms related to the problem, its foundations, and basic fundamental tools needed
* All functions written in JavaScript ES5/ES6
* Explanations simplified as much as theoretically possible

### Project timeline
* Feb. 1, 2018 - TBD

### Requirements
* Arithmatic
* Basic understanding of JavaScript ES5/ES6

### Table Of Contents
* Main Page
* [Encoding Magic Numbers: Integers](./problem1/)
* [Digital Logic](./problem2/)
* [One Time Pad](./problem3/)
* [Frequency Analysis](./problem4/)
* [Time Complexity](./problem5/)
* [Hamming Distance](./problem6/)
* [link] AES-128 in ECB? *what?*
* [link] TBD

#### Note:
I am using [Cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/) as a baseline to jumpstart my learning.  More specifically, this github repo will only cover the first set.  

The answers to the Challenge are written in Python / JavaScript and is in the answers folder.  Please, be aware of the drawbacks of looking at the solutions before investigating the solution yourself first.  If you want to see it run, you are required to have Python 2.7 then run: 
```python ./answers/set1.py```

If any of my code ( or parts of this project ) runs counter to the spirit of the challenge, please let me know.

Thank you for visiting.
